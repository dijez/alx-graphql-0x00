# Character Queries

This directory contains GraphQL queries that fetch Rick and Morty character 
data using the character(id: ID!) field.

Each query requests the following fields:
- id
- name
- status
- species
- type
- gender

Four characters were retrieved (IDs 1–4) and their responses are stored in JSON files.
