# Episode Queries

This directory contains GraphQL queries used to fetch specific episodes by ID using the episode(id: ID!) field.

Each query includes the following fields:
- id
- name
- air_date

The queries implemented cover episode IDs 1 through 4. Each query has a corresponding JSON output file containing the response returned from the API.
